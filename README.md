## General Information
- Problem Statement
A consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban
customers receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan
approval based on the applicant’s profile. If the applicant is not likely to repay the
loan, he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the
company. The aim is to reduce such type of loan
- Objective
To identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the 
amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study. 
Basically the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan 
default.
